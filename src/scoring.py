1. **2025-09-18 13:21 UTC** - For peace, justice and respect: Foreign Minister Wadephul at the UN General Debate in New York. When the representatives of the 193 UN member states gather for the annual General Debate, the eyes of the world are on New York. Heads of state and government and foreign ministers from all across the world travel to the city with their delegations in order to present their positions. UN headquarters and the streets of Manhattan along the East River are all hustle and bustle. The General Assembly – taking place this year for the 80th time – is a forum for close international coordination. For the speeches in the famous Assembly Hall with the large golden UN seal are just one element of this intense week. Countless side-events take place on the fringes of the General Assembly, facilitating substantive discussions and enabling representatives of organisations and civil-society groups to feed in their viewpoints as well. In parallel, the foreign ministers hold numerous bilateral talks with their counterparts. Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul will be visiting New York from Monday till Saturday as head of the German delegation. The United Nations in crisis Eighty years on from its foundation, the United Nations has rarely been under such pressure. Russia is still engaged in its brutal war of aggression against Ukraine; there is no sign of a resolution to the Middle East conflict; and a bloody civil war has been raging in the Sudan for almost two and a half years now. The rapid advance of artificial intelligence is bringing autonomous weapon systems within reach. People around the world expect the United Nations to be capable of action on these and other issues. Speaking prior to his departure, Foreign Minister Wadephul addressed the role of the UN: The UN Charter represents the hope that jointly agreed rules are stronger than arbitrary violence, that negotiations produce more sustainable solutions than the dominance of individuals, and that a life of dignity can be enjoyed by every human being. However, this promise, made by the world with the founding of the United Nations 80 years ago, is facing unprecedented pressure. Other pressing challenges, such as global rising sea-levels, will also be high on the agenda in New York. Not losing sight of climate change Coastal regions and low-lying island states are increasingly in jeopardy in the face of rising sea-levels. In the medium term, over 120 UN member states will be affected, with far-reaching consequences for livelihoods, food security and – in some cases – countries’ very existence. That is why Foreign Minister Wadephul will be coordinating closely with the Small Island Developing States (SIDS). This group comprises 39 states, mainly in the Caribbean and Pacific but also in the Indian Ocean and Atlantic, that are all confronted by similar challenges. Germany recognises the particular challenges facing the SIDS, which are among the hardest hit by climate change, although their contribution to it is slight. Middle East on the agenda The situation of the civilian population in Gaza remains unbearable. In New York, Foreign Minister Wadephul will emphasise demands for a ceasefire in Gaza. The hostages still being held by Hamas must be released immediately. There must be a drastic improvement in getting humanitarian assistance to the people in Gaza. At the same time, the long-term perspective for the people in the Palestinian territories must not be forgotten. A two-state solution is the only realistic option to enable Israelis and Palestinians to live side by side in future in peace and security. The specific implementation of a two-state solution will be the subject of a conference on the fringes of the General Assembly hosted on Monday by France and Saudi Arabia. Foreign Minister Wadephul will attend this conference and make Germany’s position clear: we support state-building in the Palestinian territories. However, in the German Government’s view, recognition of a Palestinian state is the end of a process of negotiation on the two-state solution.  Germany is ready to shoulder more responsibility As the second-largest contributor to the UN system, Germany has been a reliable partner to the UN for more than 50 years. Germany contributes military, police and civilian personnel to peace missions around the world. More than 30 UN organisations with well over 1000 staff members are based in Germany – in Bonn, Berlin, Munich, Hamburg and other cities. Germany’s involvement is based on the firm conviction that global issues can only be solved globally. The rules-based international order, with the Charter of the United Nations and international law as its foundation, is indispensable in this regard. It is for this reason that Germany is again applying for a non‑permanent seat on the UN Security Council for the 2027/28 term. Prior to his departure, Foreign Minister Wadephul commented: Many rightly look to Germany with the expectation that we will work for a world where peace, human rights and development are not just distant promises. By standing as a candidate for a non-permanent seat on the UN Security Council in 2027/28, we seek to assume greater responsibility once again. We support a rules-based international order with a strong United Nations at its heart in order to meet global challenges with truly global solutions. It is my firm conviction that this also provides the strongest foundation for our security, our freedom and our prosperity. German Government team in New York The Foreign Minister’s trips are always about teamwork. This is especially true of the week of the UN General Assembly. So that Germany’s interests can be represented at the numerous important events, the Minister for Economic Cooperation and Development, Reem Alabali Radovan, is travelling to New York alongside Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul. From the Federal Foreign Office, the delegation also includes Minister of State Serap Güler, Minister of State Florian Hahn, Federal Government Commissioner for Human Rights Policy Lars Castellucci and Coordinator of Transatlantic Cooperation Metin Hakverdi.

2. **2025-09-12 14:41 UTC** - Ahead to the future: Conference of the Heads of German Missions in Berlin. The annual Conference of the Heads of German Missions, or Ambassadors Conference for short, ended yesterday after four days of intensive work. Over 200 ambassadors and consuls general working around the world met at the Federal Foreign Office headquarters in Berlin. Together, they discussed current and future challenges in the foreign service as well as German foreign policy goals and their implementation. Also on the agenda were new skills that are becoming increasingly important for shaping foreign policy.  A range of workshops offered a chance to test practical approaches to actively shaping and explaining German foreign policy. There was a particular focus on modernising diplomatic instruments – from updating communication strategies to using artificial intelligence. The heads of German missions abroad, our “eyes and ears” around the world, held in-depth discussions of how they can work even more effectively and use their resources even more efficiently. Federal Chancellor Merz opened the conference on Monday together with Foreign Minister Wadephul. This made Friedrich Merz the first Federal Chancellor to attend the Ambassadors Conference at the Federal Foreign Office since Gerhard Schröder in 2000. The topics were dominated by the foreign policy issues of the day, from the security implications of the Russian war of aggression in Ukraine, to the situation in the Middle East, to Germany’s candidacy for the UN Security Council. There was also discussion of how our aims of strengthening security, preserving freedom and increasing our prosperity can be more pragmatically implemented together with global partners. One fixture of every Ambassadors Conference is the Business Forum, where the representatives of the missions abroad talk to representatives of German business – this year over 600 – about foreign trade and investment policy. Their discussions reflected the growing challenges facing German companies internationally, from unfair competition to new customs barriers. Foreign Minister Wadephul emphasised that a Zeitenwende, a turning point, is now needed in the field of foreign trade and investment policy as well. That means diversifying, minimising risks and placing the German economy and its supply chains on a broader and better footing.   At the beginning of the Business Forum, Finnish Foreign Minister Elina Valtonen spoke about the importance of a robust Europe – especially in the Baltic Sea region, which is increasingly exposed to hybrid threats from Russia. In her speech, she underlined the need for joint European security efforts to defend our European way of life and doing business. The annual gathering of the heads of German missions abroad in Berlin is an opportunity for networking and discussion for our colleagues working around the world, making it indispensable in successfully shaping German foreign policy. Ultimately, foreign policy is made by people, and is rooted in trust between them. We look forward to the 2026 Ambassadors Conference.   Since 2000, the heads of German missions abroad have met once a year in Berlin for the Ambassadors Conference. Germany has 225 missions around the world, from Abuja to Zagreb. The focus of the conference is on the goals and priorities of German foreign policy and on a modern foreign service. The first Ambassadors Conference in 2000 welcomed Federal Chancellor Schröder as a guest, and in 2025 a Federal Chancellor was once again in attendance when Friedrich Merz joined the event at the Federal Foreign Office headquarters.

3. **2025-09-01 09:30 UTC** - Focus on India: Foreign Minister Wadephul visits strategic partner in the Indo-Pacific. India, with whom we are celebrating 25 years of strategic partnership this year, is an essential key partner for us in the Indo-Pacific region. Foreign Minister Wadephul is visiting the country in order to expand this partnership in areas ranging from business and technology to security policy. The potential for more intensive cooperation with the world’s largest democracy is huge. Foreign Minister Wadephul stated the following prior to his departure: With our Strategic Partnership, our academic cooperation and our cultural agreement dating back 25, 50 and almost 60 years respectively, India is a strategic partner for Germany across the board in the Indo-Pacific and plays a crucial role in the system of global partnerships. We want to further deepen our relations across the entire spectrum and to strengthen them in particular in areas where potential has not yet been met. This is in our two countries’ mutual interest. Innovation meets partnership: itinerary in Bangalore The first stop on the trip is Bangalore, India’s vibrant innovation metropolis. Before setting off, Foreign Minister Wadephul emphasised: India is a rising and rapidly developing economic powerhouse and already a very promising global technology hub. It offers German companies great opportunities in terms of innovation, trade and supply chain diversification. India is a key partner for us worldwide as regards giving our economy a broader focus and making it more stable. This dynamism, which makes India so innovative, is exactly what I want to see for myself in Bangalore, in the heart of India, where I also want to explore even greater opportunities for cooperation. At the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), the focus will be on scientific and technological cooperation. India is already an important player in civilian space activities with whom we want to work more closely. Visits to the Mercedes-Benz research and development centre and the SAP campus show that already around 2000 German enterprises are investing heavily in India’s future and intensifying German-Indian economic cooperation. In the global innovation hub of Bangalore, Foreign Minister Wadephul will speak with skilled workers and managers about digitisation, mobility and prospects for skilled workers in Germany. The visit to the Goethe-Institut will centre on language training for highly qualified skilled workers from India, who are urgently needed in Germany. Scientific cooperation will be the focus of the visit to the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), one of the leading research institutions in Asia. Topics such as the green transformation and artificial intelligence bring together German and Indian interests. Visit to New Delhi: dialogue on global issues India and Germany share fundamental interests in a shifting world order – for example in strengthening multilateralism, international law and a rules based trade system. As democracies, India and Germany are natural partners. In the capital New Delhi, Foreign Minister Wadephul will engage in dialogue on these topics with representatives of Indian think tanks. High level political talks with Indian Foreign Minister Jaishankar, among others, will focus not least on global security, regional stability and building on the strategic partnership between India and Germany. A reliable partner in the Indo-Pacific Today, India is one of the fastest growing economies in the world – as well as a lively democracy with mounting international influence. Prior to his departure, Foreign Minister Wadephul emphasised: Germany and India have set themselves the goal of expanding and strengthening their mutual relations. This is a partnership based on mutual trust and reliability. His visit underscores the fact that Germany is counting on partnership with India in the areas of politics, business and science.

4. **2025-08-29 15:23 UTC** - For a strong Europe. Foreign Minister Wadephul at the Franco-German Council of Ministers and the meeting of EU foreign ministers in Copenhagen. Germany and France generating strong momentum for the EU The current crises call for close cooperation between Germany and France, particularly on the issue of Ukraine and the question of joint security guarantees. On Friday, leading government members from Berlin and Paris are therefore gathering in Toulon for the first Franco-German Council of Ministers under the new German Government. Federal Chancellor Friedrich Merz and President Emmanuel Macron agree that the Franco-German alliance must once again become the engine of Europe. Eight joint strategy papers and twenty beacon projects will therefore shape future cooperation in key sectors such as industry, technology, research, quantum physics, artificial intelligence and defence. With our closest neighbours, we share the view that in Toulon the focus needs to be on reduction of bureaucracy and on joint innovation in order to strengthen Europe’s competitiveness. After all, the EU internal market is our greatest strength. Now is the right time to take bold steps towards expanding and intensifying this market. Consensus between Germany and France is the key to generating new momentum for the EU. Only if its members work together can the EU act as a global player and deal with challenges such as economic competitiveness and security policy. Franco-German Council of Ministers Since the 40th anniversary of the Elysée Treaty in 2003, the Franco-German governmental consultations have been held in the form of joint ministerial councils where the two cabinets come together, initially twice a year, but for many years now annually as a rule. Since the signing of the Treaty of Aachen in 2019, they have also provided an overview of the progress made on implementing the measures relating to the Treaty. In 2023, Germany and France agreed to adapt the format and replace the meetings attended by all ministers with informal retreats and ministerial councils on a smaller scale with a thematic focus. The informal format was implemented for the first time for the joint cabinet meeting in Hamburg in autumn 2023. An ambitious economic agenda (Meseberg Agenda) was adopted at the last Council of Ministers at Schloss Meseberg in May 2024. This year’s Franco-German Council of Ministers once again places a focus on innovation and European competitiveness. Support for Ukraine and the situation in the Middle East on the agenda of the informal meeting of EU foreign ministers Immediately after the talks in Toulon, Foreign Minister Wadephul will travel to Copenhagen with his French counterpart Barrot for the informal meeting of EU foreign ministers, the so called Gymnich meeting. Alongside increased support for Ukraine and the question of reliable security guarantees, new sanctions packages targeting Russia are at the top of the agenda. The meeting, to which representatives from Iceland, Norway, the United Kingdom and Ukraine have also been invited, is a symbol of pan European unity. The situation in the Middle East is another prominent issue, particularly the humanitarian disaster in the Gaza Strip, the developments in the West Bank and the situation in Iran. European foreign policy must maintain its united front and its capability to act in the face of a myriad of crises. In conclusion, the ministers will therefore discuss their working methods as well as ways to make decision making more efficient, for example through qualified majority voting. With the meetings in Toulon and Copenhagen, Germany, France and their European partners are sending a clear message for a united, strong Europe which confronts challenges in a spirit of solidarity and works actively to find solutions to promote peace, security and competitiveness.

5. **2025-08-28 16:00 UTC** - The Iranian nuclear programme. After a protracted conflict surrounding the Iranian nuclear programme due to justified doubts about its exclusively civilian nature, Germany, France, the United Kingdom, the United States, Russia, China and Iran signed the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPoA) on 14 July 2015 in an attempt to resolve this conflict at the negotiating table. The United Nations Security Council approved the JCPoA under Resolution 2231 (2015). As coordinator, the High Representative of the European Union plays a key role in the implementation of the JCPoA, which initially met with success. Until mid-2019, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) repeatedly confirmed in its quarterly reports that Iran was adhering to the JCPoA undertakings. Iran also benefited from the agreement. Sanctions were eased as agreed and the country’s economy and foreign trade with Germany and Europe grew. The JCPOA in crisis On 8 May 2018, US President Donald Trump announced the United States’ withdrawal from the JCPoA. The US re-imposed the sanctions against Iran that it had previously suspended and gradually enforced further restrictive measures. Many of these measures are secondary sanctions, which had an extra-territorial effect on Iran’s trading partners in third countries. Since 2019, Iran has been gradually abandoning its nuclear-related commitments under the JCPoA and further stepped up its systematic violations of the JCPoA on the basis of a “strategic nuclear law” passed in December 2020. Iran increased its production of low-enriched uranium, began enriching uranium up to 60 percent, abandoned the agreed limits for research and development on advanced centrifuges, recommenced uranium enrichment at the underground plant in Fordow, reduced transparency with regard to its nuclear programme by restricting access for inspectors and started experiments to extract uranium metals without plausible civilian justification. The Vienna talks on the restoration of the JCPOA The US Administration under President Biden announced its determination to return to the nuclear agreement and to repeal the nuclear-related secondary sanctions imposed or reinstated by the previous Administration, provided Iran also adhered once again to its obligations. Negotiations between the JCPoA participants and the US were held in Vienna from April to June 2021 and from November 2021 to March 2022, during which an agreement on these issues was outlined. However, Iran ultimately rejected the compromise packages submitted in March and August 2022 by the European External Action Service (EEAS) as JCPoA coordinator, thus preventing the complete restoration of the JCPoA. In view of Iran’s significant and ongoing breaches of the JCPoA, the E3 countries – Germany, France and the United Kingdom – have retained the nuclear-related sanctions at EU level and under UK law, although under the JCPoA these were due to be repealed on Transition Day (18 October 2023).  Triggering of the snapback mechanism and reimposition of sanctions The Iranian nuclear programme has reached a dangerous level in 2025. Since 2019, Iran has been in significant breach of the commitments enshrined in the JCPoA. Despite intensive efforts by the E3 countries (Germany, France and the United Kingdom), Iran has not shown any willingness to meet its obligations under the JCPoA in a transparent and sustained manner. This is fuelling concerns that Iran is aiming to acquire nuclear weapons. A nuclear armed Iran would be extremely dangerous and further destabilise the already fragile region. As a result, the E3 triggered the snapback mechanism under UN Resolution 2231 on 28 August 2025. In accordance with the JCPoA, six previously suspended UN resolutions will re-enter into force 30 days after the snapback mechanism has been triggered, i.e. at the end of September 2025. The restoring of these resolutions would mean, for example, that all UN member states would be prohibited from supplying Iran with nuclear or missile-related products; in addition, the UN Security Council would reimpose an arms embargo on Iran. At the same time, the E3 Foreign Ministers underlined in a joint declaration that the door remains open for a negotiated solution. It is up to Iran to meet its obligations under the JCPoA, particularly as regards adhering to the limits for nuclear enrichment and working transparently with the IAEA.

6. **2025-08-28 15:12 UTC** - Security in the Baltic Sea region: Foreign Minister Wadephul travels to Estonia and Denmark. Talks will focus on European security and joint support for Ukraine, as well as cooperation on energy issues and the protection of critical infrastructure. This trip will also lay the groundwork for the informal EU Foreign Ministers meeting in Copenhagen on Saturday, where further support for Ukraine and Europe’s responsibility for security policy are on the agenda. Strong partners of Ukraine Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine is having far‑reaching consequences, which are particularly evident in the Baltic Sea region. Here, the activities of the Russian shadow fleet, the manipulation of navigation systems and targeted attacks on underwater pipelines and cables directly threaten the security of Europe. Foreign Minister Wadephul stated the following prior to his departure: It is clear that the Baltic’s security is also our security. In the Baltic Sea region, you get a strong sense of the extent to which this security is under threat. It is where Russia’s shadow fleet is up to no good, where cables are being cut, buoys moved and GPS signals jammed – it is where we see Russia using its entire toolkit of hybrid aggression. Estonia and the Baltic states issued warnings early on about how real the dangers are. Today, we benefit from their far-sightedness and expertise in the EU and in NATO, and we want to further deepen this cooperation.  Estonia: Pioneer in cyber defence and tackling disinformation The first stop of the trip is Tallinn, where Foreign Minister Wadephul will address the Estonian diplomatic corps and highlight the close partnership between Germany and Estonia. One focus is on joint initiatives against hybrid threats, including cyber attacks, disinformation campaigns and attempted interference by pro-Kremlin networks. Together with Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, Germany has launched the Resilience Initiative, which tackles disinformation and digital interference in a targeted manner. It comprises awareness-raising and educational programmes, a Youth Media Lab, summer schools and multilingual publications for young people. Estonia has a reputation for being a global pioneer in cyber defence and digital administration. For NATO and the EU, it is an indispensable partner on the eastern flank. In Tallinn, Foreign Minister Wadephul will therefore also discuss efforts to strengthen joint defence measures – including the deployment of a German brigade in Lithuania, surveillance missions in the Baltic Sea and air defence in the Baltic region. Denmark: Key partner in the European Union In the afternoon, the Foreign Minister will continue to Copenhagen, where talks with his Danish counterpart Lars Løkke Rasmussen and Minister for European Affairs Marie Bjerre are planned. Their discussions will focus on protecting critical infrastructure in the Baltic and North Seas and deepening energy cooperation, as well as coordination within the EU. Both countries are already benefiting from projects such as cross-border offshore wind farms, joint hydrogen projects and initiatives to protect power lines and data cables. This cooperation is set to be further expanded by the 2026 North Sea Summit. Furthermore, Germany and Denmark are linked by close cooperation as neighbours: More than 70 joint projects have been implemented in recent years in the fields of agriculture, digital transformation and health – directly benefiting people in the German-Danish border region.

7. **2025-08-25 11:58 UTC** - EU enlargement and its geopolitical dimension: Foreign Minister Wadephul visits Croatia. Foreign Minister Wadephul is travelling to Zagreb today for his first official visit to Croatia. The main focus of the trip will be talks with his Croatian counterpart Gordan Grlić Radman and Prime Minister Andrej Plenković. Foreign Minister Wadephul will also be the guest of honour at the Croatian conference of ambassadors, where he will deliver a speech to the members of Croatia’s Foreign Service. Prior to his departure, Foreign Minister Wadephul emphasised the close ties between Germany and Croatia:  Croatia is more than a close and reliable partner for Germany – it is a role model for European integration. Croatia’s successful accession to the EU showed how willingness to undertake reforms, determination and courage can change a country and provide people with a sense of opportunity. Germany and Croatia are now closer than ever before. Over the last ten years, our bilateral trade with Croatia increased more than with any other EU member. At a time when free global trade is under pressure, it is critical that we have a strong EU single market.  For a strong EU – prosperity, trade and security The talks in Zagreb will cover a wide range of European policy topics, ranging from foreign and security policy to support for Ukraine and European trade policy. Croatia plays a special role in this respect. As the most recent country to join the EU, it is able to contribute valuable European policy insights, not least regarding key issues such as defence and security. Croatia is an active member of NATO and is also a reliable partner when it comes to ensuring that support is provided to Ukraine. Economic ties between Germany and Croatia have become a role model for the EU single market in recent years. For commuters, businesspeople and the many tourists from Germany who travel to Croatia each summer to visit its coastal region, the advantages of open borders thanks to the country’s membership of the Schengen area are both a real accomplishment and a much appreciated everyday reality. The promise of EU enlargement Another focus of the visit is Croatia’s role as a bridge-builder in the EU enlargement process. The country itself is an impressive illustration of successful European integration. Croatia’s willingness to implement reforms and its rapid development have shown the extent to which strict alignment with European values such as the rule of law and fundamental rights can pay off. Not only does Europe have the largest single market in the world, but the EU holds out the promise of a life in security, prosperity and freedom, which also inspires hope in Croatia’s neighbouring countries that are candidates for membership. In addition, the German Government sees EU enlargement as a response to current geopolitical challenges. In light of Russia’s war of aggression and the rise of great power rivalry, EU enlargement is an investment in peace, security and stability. This is why Germany strongly supports the prospect of accession of Ukraine, the Republic of Moldova and the countries of the Western Balkans. Croatia and its expertise play a key role in the EU enlargement process. The country’s experience and credibility make it an indispensable mediator, and Germany believes that Croatia plays a vital role in fostering EU enlargement. We want to work together to ensure that swift progress is now made in the enlargement process. Within the EU, Croatia stands to benefit most from this.

8. **2025-08-17 09:44 UTC** - Visiting key partners in Asia: Foreign Minister Wadephul travels to Japan and Indonesia. Germany and Japan are many hours away from each other by plane. And yet the two countries and societies are very close – we share values and interests with Japan, and our economic ties are diverse. There is also close political coordination on a regular basis: in formats such as the G7 or at joint intergovernmental consultations, which took place for the first time in 2023. After his arrival in Tokyo, Foreign Minister Wadephul will meet his Japanese counterpart Takeshi Iwaya for a strategic dialogue and will then have talks with other representatives of the Japanese Government. The focus will be on security issues: to be more precise, security in Europe, which is under threat due to Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine. Despite its geographical distance from Europe, Japan is providing Ukraine with considerable support – among other things, Japan has assisted Ukraine with the procurement of vital Patriot air defence systems. Focus on economic security During the Minister’s talks in Japan, the security of the German and European economies will be discussed, as will international trading routes, on which major economies such as Germany and Japan are particularly reliant. In the Indo-Pacific, China is being increasingly assertive in striving for regional hegemony and in this process is also calling principles of international law into question. This shows that the freedom, security and prosperity of Europe and the Indo-Pacific are closely interlinked. That is why Germany remains committed to strengthening the rules-based international order in the Indo-Pacific region. Foreign Minister Wadephul will therefore once more champion the principles of free shipping routes, of open markets and free trade during his visit. Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul stated the following prior to his departure: China’s increasingly aggressive stance in the Taiwan Strait and in the East and South China Seas also has consequences for us in Europe: basic rules of global cooperation are at stake here. We are countering this together through our commitment to an international order based on the strength of the law and on binding rules for all. Japan hosting the world at the EXPO in Osaka The Minister will travel on the Shinkansen, Japan’s high-speed train, to the country’s second largest city, Osaka, which lies further to the west. The train takes only 2 hours and 11 minutes for the journey, which is just over 500 kilometres. Japan is hosting the world in Osaka this year at EXPO 2025. As a window to the future, the world exhibition shows how we can make our societies more resilient and better equipped for the future through innovative technology and cooperation. Foreign Minister Wadephul will visit both the Japanese and the German pavilions in the EXPO grounds. The German pavilion is focusing on the circular economy: the cylindrical buildings were constructed in a fully circular fashion, which means that all the materials used can be re-used or recycled. Indonesia: Economic power with great potential After his visit to Japan, Foreign Minister Wadephul will travel on to Indonesia. With more than 280 million inhabitants, the country is the fourth most populous country on earth. Indonesia is thus an important democratic partner in the region and our relations are close and friendly. In Jakarta, Foreign Minister Wadephul will have political talks with his colleague Sugiono. As a rising economic power, Indonesia holds great potential for Germany. Following ten years of negotiations, the EU and Indonesia only recently agreed on a free trade agreement, which is expected to be signed in the autumn. Many German companies are already successfully investing in Indonesia. Among other things, Foreign Minister Wadephul will visit a production plant in Jakarta operated by the German commercial vehicle manufacturer Daimler Truck. Indonesia also plays a key role in the region: the headquarters of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), a group of ten states in the region which have joined together to coordinate political and economic matters, is in Jakarta. Alongside Indonesia, member states include Thailand, the Philippines and Singapore. Foreign Minister Wadephul will meet ASEAN Secretary-General Kao Kim Hourn. The Foreign Minister’s trips always involve teamwork. The visits to Japan and Indonesia offer a good opportunity to intensify the full spectrum of our relations. The Foreign Minister will therefore be accompanied on his trip by members of the German Bundestag and a business delegation.

9. **2025-08-15 14:10 UTC** - Germany stands firmly by the side of the people in Ukraine. Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine has brought immeasurable suffering to millions of people. The war is directly affecting not only the Ukrainian soldiers who are defending their homeland and Europe’s security on the front lines, but also the civilian population, including elderly people, women and children. The Russian armed forces’ targeted attacks on civilian targets such as schools, hospitals, kindergartens or residential buildings, as well as civilian infrastructure, including power plants that produce heat and electricity, and the water supply, are particularly perfidious. Russia is thereby attempting to wear down the people in Ukraine and deprive them of what they need to live. This is why the German Government is giving top priority to providing swift and targeted assistance to the Ukrainians. For Ukraine to protect itself and defend our peace in Europe, the German Government has to date (as at 15 August 2025) made available or earmarked for the coming years approx. 34 billion euro in bilateral civilian support and approx. 40 billion euro in military assistance. This aid includes air defence, substantial winter relief programmes and energy assistance, help for people who have fled Ukraine or been displaced within the country, humanitarian assistance and mine clearance operations, as well as stabilisation projects that provide urgently needed supplies for civilian security forces. Germany is also providing support for Ukraine’s process of accession to the European Union, including the necessary reform process. Moreover, Ukraine and Germany signed a comprehensive bilateral agreement on security cooperation on 16 February 2024. Political support and peace efforts We are convinced that, for there to be sustainable peace, Ukraine must be strong. Our lasting support is crucial to this end. Together with our partners, we have been making every effort to bring about peace through a diplomatic agreement. We support US President Trump’s objective of ending Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine, and our goal continues to be a just and lasting peace. Ukraine has repeatedly signalled its willingness to negotiate. Europe expressly supports this and stands firmly by Ukraine’s side. Furthermore, we are discussing issues relating to a ceasefire, security in the Black Sea, reconstruction and the prosecution of Russian war crimes in a number of international forums – be it in the UN, NATO, the Council of Europe, the OSCE, the G7, the EU or specifically established forums such as the Berlin format.  Ukrainian President Zelensky has regularly stressed that Ukraine is willing to negotiate and has expressly said he is ready to enter into an unconditional ceasefire. However, the peace process is, first and foremost, dependent on Russia’s willingness to negotiate. What we have observed, however, is that Russia continues to make maximum demands while continuing and even intensifying its attacks on Ukraine. We are therefore maintaining our support for Ukraine, because we believe that if Russia ends its attacks, that will be the end of the war. If Ukraine stops defending itself, that will be the end of Ukraine.  For a regularly updated overview of bilateral support, click here. Military support for Ukraine Ukraine must be able to defend itself against Russia’s war of aggression, which violates international law. Germany is therefore supporting Ukraine by supplying arms and equipment, from its Bundeswehr stockpiles and from defence industry deliveries that are paid for out of the German budget. When providing this assistance, the German Government tailors its aid to the needs of Ukraine and continuously explores where it would be useful and possible to step up its assistance, e.g. with regard to air defence. In the EU, agreement was reached in 2021 on the establishment of European Peace Facility (EPF) support measures for the armed forces of Ukraine to the tune of 5.6 billion euro. These measures take the form of a refinancing mechanism for equipment supplied on a bilateral basis and repair services provided by the EU member states. Member states contribute to this on the basis of a cost share formula that reflects their respective gross national income. Germany’s contribution amounts to approximately 25 percent. Mandatory contributions totalling 521 million euro have already been paid. In March 2024, a decision was taken to establish the Ukraine Assistance Fund within the EPF, and the target for its initial volume was set at an additional five billion euro by the year 2027. Germany, alongside other allies, has offered to fund one of the first comprehensive support packages totalling up to 500 million US dollars within the framework of the PURL mechanism (Prioritised Ukraine Requirements List). US President Donald Trump announced on 14 July that the United States will supply Ukraine with military equipment and ammunition in the form of several support packages. Under the PURL mechanism, NATO will coordinate implementation and, at the same time, ensure that the items included in the packages meet Ukraine’s most urgent needs. The European partners and Canada are to provide the funding. The support packages will include military equipment that is either not manufactured by the European defence industry or that can be delivered at the intended scale more swiftly by the United States than by European partners or Canada. This includes, for example, critical air defence capabilities. These are urgently needed to counter Russia’s ongoing airstrikes, which are killing ever more civilians throughout Ukraine.  Stabilisation, humanitarian assistance, support for the energy sector and winter relief The Federal Foreign Office has provided 227 million euro for stabilisation work since the start of Russia’s war of aggression in order to strengthen the resilience of the Ukrainian state and its ability to act. A particular focus is on the liberated and frontline areas as these regions have been particularly affected by the war. Urgently needed vehicles, generators and protective equipment for civilian security forces are being delivered there, for example.  The Federal Foreign Office is also supporting Ukraine’s committed civil society, which is a key factor behind social cohesion in the country. We are also lending our assistance to the EU accession process and judicial reform. As the second-biggest donor worldwide and the largest donor in the EU, the Federal Foreign Office provides humanitarian assistance to humanitarian partner organisations in Ukraine and Ukraine’s neighbouring countries, to alleviate the severe suffering of the population caused by Russia’s war of aggression. Since February 2022, the Federal Foreign Office has made available a total of more than 1.4 billion euro in humanitarian assistance, thereby helping Ukraine through three cold winters. Alongside our partners, we are also providing assistance to those who have to stay behind near the front lines – such as the elderly, the seriously ill and people with disabilities – as well as to internally displaced persons all across Ukraine. We are placing a special focus on mental and psychosocial support for Ukrainians, as well as assistance in the case of gender-based and sexual violence, and as regards the return and reintegration of abducted Ukrainian children. Another priority of our support is the Ukrainian energy sector, which is the focus of Russian attacks. Germany is the largest bilateral donor to the Ukraine Energy Support Fund of the Energy Community, a European organisation. One area in which the German Government is providing support is emergency energy assistance – thereby ensuring that the population is supplied with electricity, heat and water. This includes repairs, additional capacity for electricity generation and protecting the infrastructure. In addition, we are also working with our Ukrainian partners to rebuild the energy infrastructure in a decentralised, environmentally friendly way, with a focus on energy efficiency and the expansion of renewable energy. Additional funding of support through windfall profits and G7 loans  In reaction to Russia’s attack on Ukraine violating international law, assets of the Russian state in the EU were immobilised. It is clear that Russia will have to pay for the damage it has caused in Ukraine with its war. The UN General Assembly emphatically reaffirmed this duty based on the principle of state responsibility recognised under customary international law in a resolution adopted on 14 November 2022.  Furthermore, the G7 Heads of State and Government agreed back at the G7 Summit in Hiroshima in 2023 to release immobilised assets only once Russia has paid for the damage in Ukraine. In the meantime, the EU has agreed on a regulation to skim off the windfall profits of the central securities depositories. The regulation on windfall profits adopted by the EU has a solid foundation in EU law and is in accordance with international law. On the basis of this, the G7 announced on 25 October 2024 that it had agreed to make available to Ukraine a loan totalling around 45 billion euro (50 billion US dollars) using the windfall profits. The EU’s share of this loan will be paid to Ukraine in instalments up to the end of 2025 in the form of an exceptional Macro-Financial Assistance loan amounting to 18.1 billion euro.  Documenting and punishing crimes committed as part of the Russian war of aggression In its war of aggression against Ukraine, Russia is also severely violating international humanitarian law and committing massive human rights abuses in Ukraine, such as the killing and torture of prisoners of war and civilians. The Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) has promptly initiated investigations. Germany is supporting these investigations, both financially and by seconding experts. The German Government is also assisting the Ukrainian authorities in the collection of evidence, for example by supplying forensic equipment. Germany supports the Register of Damage for Ukraine established by the Council of Europe to prepare reparation claims based on damage caused by Russia’s war of aggression. The Register has its seat in The Hague and took up its work at the beginning of February 2024. Germany provides financial support – approximately two million euro to date – and has currently seconded one expert to assist in its work. In mid December 2024, the Claims Register issued its first decision. Since then, 12,000 claims for damage to or destruction of residential property have been assessed as justified and officially entered in the register. Negotiations are currently underway to establish a Claims Commission for Ukraine, which will examine the registered claims, determine the amount of compensation sought and manage the register. Germany argues that violations of international law committed as part of Russia’s war of aggression should not go unpunished and therefore lends strong support to the envisaged establishment of a special tribunal for the crime of aggression against Ukraine. An unprecedented sanctions regime For as long as Russia continues to brutally attack Ukraine, there must be consequences. Germany and its European partners have responded by imposing massive and unprecedented sanctions and will continue to increase this pressure, i.e. by restricting Russian access to capital markets, imposing substantial export bans, especially in the spheres of advanced technology, industry and energy infrastructure, placing a price cap on Russian oil exports to third countries, imposing wide-ranging import bans, e.g. on coal, oil, iron and steel products as well as gold and diamonds from Russia, taking tough measures targeting Russia’s aviation sector, and directly sanctioning Russia’s President Putin, Foreign Minister Lavrov, further political and military decision-makers, war criminals, propagandists and the network of oligarchs that supports them. EU sanctions also target Russia’s “shadow fleet” and its networks of third countries for circumventing sanctions, so that Russia’s income and supply with goods needed for the war are further curtailed. For more on the sanctions that are currently in effect, click here. Reconstruction The German Government, together with Ukraine and our partners in the EU and the G7, is already beginning to plan how Ukraine can rebuild. In December 2022, the G7 and Ukraine agreed to establish an international Donor Coordination Platform for the country’s reconstruction. Although reconstruction will require significant international efforts, it also presents a great opportunity to invest in Ukraine’s future, and, in so doing, to modernise the state and the economy, to bring about ecological transformation and, not least, to implement national reforms and make progress towards EU accession. On 11 and 12 June 2024, Germany and Ukraine co hosted an international gathering in Berlin, the Ukraine Recovery Conference (URC 2024). After Lugano in 2022 and London in 2023, this was the first URC to be held in an EU member state since the start of the war of aggression. More than 3400 participants from 60 countries met under the conference heading “United in Defence. United in Recovery. Stronger together” and showed their support for Ukraine not least by signing 110 agreements and contracts. A detailed list of conference outcomes and the Co Chairs’ Statement of the German and Ukrainian Governments can be found here. The next conference (URC 2025) was held in Rome on 10 and 11 July 2025. The German Government delegation was led by Federal Chancellor Merz, who, together with European Commission President von der Leyen and other European partners, announced the establishment of the European Ukraine Recovery Fund. Tremendous willingness to help Many people in Germany have great sympathy for the fate of the people in Ukraine, and the tremendous willingness to help is also reflected in civil society. The large number of donated items has resulted in aid organisations needing to do a significant amount of coordination work. The German Government therefore supports the appeal to refrain from donating items and whenever possible to donate money to established aid organisations instead. Donations can be made via Aktion Deutschland Hilft and the Disaster Relief Alliance (“Aktionsbündnis Katastrophenhilfe”). By adding the subject “Nothilfe Ukraine” (emergency aid for Ukraine) to bank transfers, the money will be spent on relief measures for people in Ukraine. Further information on the help required by refugees in Ukraine and on the admission of war refugees to Germany can be found here.

10. **2025-07-17 13:37 UTC** - For security and prosperity in Europe: Germany and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland conclude a Treaty on Friendship and Bilateral Cooperation. Friendship Treaty signed on 17 July 2025 The Treaty on Friendship and Bilateral Cooperation was signed in London on 17 July 2025 by Federal Chancellor Friedrich Merz and Prime Minister Keir Starmer, as well as by Foreign Ministers Johann Wadephul and David Lammy. The United Kingdom is one of the closest partners that Germany and the European Union have. Our good relations are rooted in our shared values and interests. The two countries have worked together closely for decades and collaborate in a spirit of trust to deal with current challenges. This Treaty now establishes a bilateral framework for our enhanced cooperation. On 16 July, Germany’s Cabinet gave its approval for the Treaty to be signed. Click here to read the text of the Friendship Treaty in German and in English. Spectrum of German-British relations The Treaty covers the whole range of German-British relations, while placing a focus on security and defence. The Treaty builds on the already strong defence relations between Germany and the UK, and reaffirms the countries’ commitment to NATO as the foundation of our Euro-Atlantic security. It also contains a commitment to each other’s defence, thereby underscoring the significance of our security-policy relations. Further topics covered by the Treaty include cooperation in the spheres of the economy, energy and climate action, migration, science, digitalisation, modernisation of the state, and people-to-people contacts. Negotiations on the Treaty began in September 2024 under the auspices of the foreign ministries. The Treaty has the aim of promoting prosperity, growth and innovation. This means, for example, that the two countries will work together to take full advantage of the opportunities arising from the renewable energy potential in the North Sea. It is people that forge our close relationship Increasing exchange between young people is thus also a key issue for Germany and the United Kingdom. From 2026, the UK will again allow group applications for school pupils, thus allowing visa-free travel for school classes and facilitating exchange. This is one of a total of 17 lighthouse projects that were agreed to flank the Treaty and which lend tangible form to the enhanced cooperation between Germany and the UK in many areas.  Relations between Germany and the UK are multifaceted and embodied by initiatives pursued at all levels – from small local communities to national level. There are for example some 400 twinning schemes linking German and British towns. The German Länder, the federal states, have an important role to play in this regard on the German side. A selection of the projects pursued by the Länder can be found here.

11. **2025-07-17 07:01 UTC** - Friendship, partnership and security in challenging times: Foreign Minister Wadephul in London, Oslo and Paris. Unity on the crucial issues of our age Foreign Minister Wadephul is travelling to London with Federal Chancellor Merz to sign the German-UK Friendship Treaty. He will also meet with his British counterpart David Lammy to discuss current international challenges. Coordination with our British partners and friends – be it on Iran, Ukraine or the Indo-Pacific, be it bilaterally, in formats such as the E3 (Germany, UK and France), Weimar+ (the Weimar Triangle countries Germany, France and Poland plus other European partners), or together with the United States – is vital for security and stability. A new foundation for the decades to come – the signing of the German-UK Friendship Treaty Bilateral relations are being raised to a new level with today’s signing of the Treaty between the Federal Republic of Germany and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland on Friendship and Bilateral Cooperation in the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. The Treaty deepens our cooperation in key spheres such as security, defence, the economy, migration and civil society, and establishes a new bilateral foundation for the decades to come. The intensive negotiations under the auspices of the two countries’ foreign ministries began in September 2024 and have been completed in under a year. Following the Treaty’s passage through the Cabinet on 16 July 2025 and signature on 17 July 2025, it must be approved by the German Bundestag. The Treaty lays down the legal framework for German-UK relations. It is flanked by an Implementation Plan that sets out the concrete benefits that such an agreement could bring for the people of both countries. More information, including the text of the Treaty, the Implementation Plan and facts on the regional dimension can be found here. Talks in Norway: Focus on security Foreign Minister Wadephul will continue his journey to Oslo for his first visit since assuming office. There he will meet his counterpart Espen Barth Eide. Norway and Germany are close partners. The two countries cooperate in NATO, are partners in the European Economic Area, pursue bilateral energy relations, and work together to promote human rights, the rule of law and cooperation in multilateral fora. Norway shares a border with Russia. The security threat posed by Russia, as demonstrated by its war of aggression against Ukraine, is particularly obvious in its immediate neighbourhood. The Ministers’ talks will therefore focus on what this means for Europe’s security architecture. Germany and Norway want to further intensify their close cooperation in NATO in this context. Other topics for discussion include the protection of critical infrastructure, the situation in the Middle East, and energy and defence policy issues. Cooperation on armaments, defence and business For more than 50 years, Germany and Norway have cooperated closely under an arms agreement, in particular in the naval sector. The joint development and procurement of submarines is a unique venture, and a sign of the close cooperation and great trust between the two countries.  Germany has furthermore been one of Norway’s most important trading partners for many years, and the two countries cooperate closely in the energy sector. Germany currently obtains approximately 48% of its gas imports from Norway. The NordLink power cable has connected German wind power and Norwegian hydropower since April 2021. The visit will therefore also focus on advancing the joint energy partnership. Start of a Franco-German summer France is Germany’s closest partner. On Friday morning, Foreign Minister Wadephul will be in Paris for in-depth discussions with his French counterpart Jean-Noël Barrot. The ministers’ agenda will cover all the key European and international issues – from strengthening the EU’s defence capability to the transatlantic alliance and the crises in the Middle East. Such a close friendship and partnership needs to be constantly nurtured and further developed. The next few weeks will see numerous meetings and arrangements between Germany and France, including at the highest level: President Emmanuel Macron will be meeting Federal Chancellor Friedrich Merz, for instance.  At the end of August, the two countries’ cabinets will meet in Toulon for the Franco-German Council of Ministers, to ensure that the Franco-German engine is well positioned for the years ahead. With the new German Government in office, the priority now is to inject fresh impetus into our very close and good relationship with France, for example by pressing ahead with joint armaments projects and engaging in strategic cooperation, working together in the EU for a modernised budget for the coming years, and strengthening our competitiveness in Europe.

12. **2025-07-10 06:23 UTC** - Bilateral relations, security in Europe, the situation in the Middle East: Foreign Minister Wadephul is travelling to Vienna for bilateral talks. Germany and Austria are far more than just neighbours. The two countries are closely interlinked thanks to a lively border region, close economic integration and countless interpersonal connections. Every day, thousands of commuters cross the border on their way to work or university, or to visit friends and family. Foreign Minister Wadephul is travelling to Vienna today to lend new impetus to this partnership at the heart of Europe. In conjunction with his Austrian counterpart Beate Meinl-Reisinger, he wants to find answers to the pressing foreign and security policy challenges of our times. Consolidating our partnership – for a strong Europe Germany and Austria wish to further expand their cooperation, which is already very close. In addition to regular meetings at EU level, bilateral talks on European strategic issues are to be held more frequently. The two countries share various aims. For example, they both seek to tie the Western Balkans more closely to the EU and to move the enlargement process forward. The two countries are also linked by close economic ties. The advantages that European cooperation brings for the people are particularly obvious in the border region: jobs are being created, prosperity is growing. To further facilitate this interaction, both countries want to do yet more to reduce obstacles to cross-border cooperation and dismantle bureaucratic hurdles. Solidarity with Ukraine: Call for rigorous action The talks in Vienna will also focus on the dramatically deteriorating situation in Ukraine. The latest Russian attacks have caused numerous civilian casualties and destroyed vital infrastructure. Germany and Austria agree that Europe must now respond with determination and unity – not least by taking stricter measures against those who circumvent sanctions against Russia and by ensuring that the next EU sanctions package enters into force more quickly. Trade policy: Ensuring growth and competitiveness External trade relations are another item on the agenda in Vienna. Germany and Austria are working together to promote open markets and fair trade. One key aim is to avoid a trade dispute between the EU and the United States, and above all to avoid high tariffs, which would put a strain on European businesses and consumers. The EU-Mercosur free trade agreement will also be discussed. Germany is pushing for swift progress to be made, since this agreement with four South American countries could greatly boost exports and sustainable growth. Talks with Israel’s Foreign Minister: Focus on Gaza While in Vienna, Foreign Minister Wadephul will also meet his Israeli counterpart Gideon Sa’ar. Their talks will focus on the dramatic humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip. Almost every day, people are killed whilst trying to distribute aid or to get aid themselves. Germany is urgently calling for a massive increase in humanitarian assistance, above all through more UN aid convoys, adequate amounts of fuel for hospitals and waterworks, as well as unhindered access to all parts of the Gaza Strip. At the same time, Germany is working hard for a ceasefire that will make it possible for all hostages still held by Hamas to be released. In the long term, a political solution is needed that guarantees Israel’s security and gives the Palestinians prospects for the future – on the basis of a negotiated two-state solution.

13. **2025-07-08 08:25 UTC** - Democracy, Human Rights, the Rule of Law – 75 Years of Germany in the Council of Europe. Since it was established on 5 May 1949, the Council of Europe has underpinned the protection of human rights, the promotion of democracy and the rule of law, and cooperation throughout Europe. It is above all in times of crisis and when faced with challenges that the free Europe must work yet more closely together – in order to strengthen our shared values and in the interests of economic and social progress. The Council of Europe: a guarantor of democracy, human rights and the rule of law The Council of Europe has played a trailblazing role in creating a binding pan‑European legal framework for the protection of democracy, human rights and the rule of law. To date, there are well over 200 Council of Europe conventions and protocols. These include basic legal instruments such as the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (ECHR), the European Convention for the Prevention of Torture, the European Social Charter, the Istanbul Convention (on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence), and the Framework Convention on Artificial Intelligence and Human Rights. On 25 June 2025, a bilateral agreement between Ukraine and the Council of Europe concerning a Special Tribunal for the Crime of Aggression against Ukraine was signed in Strasbourg – another milestone. The establishment of the Special Tribunal is intended to ensure that Russia’s leadership will be legally held to account for planning and carrying out the illegal war of aggression against Ukraine. More information can be found here.   75 Years of Germany in the Council of Europe In 2025, Germany is celebrating 75 years as a member of the Council of Europe. The Council of Europe was the first international organisation to admit Germany as a member after the Second World War. This special occasion was marked by the Council of Europe Anniversary Conference in the Federal Foreign Office in Berlin on 8 July 2025, hosted by the Council of Europe and the Federal Foreign Office, with the support of the European Movement Germany e.V. The event started with a welcome by the President of the European Movement Germany and the Secretary General of the Council of Europe, and opening remarks by Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul. Click here to read the Foreign Minister’s full statement. The more than 400 participants from the worlds of politics, science, public administration, justice and society then convened for various panel discussions. The topics were supporting Ukraine through the Council of Europe, democracy under pressure and potential responses by the Council of Europe, as well as future challenges to the Council of Europe.

14. **2025-07-04 12:52 UTC** - Strengthen the border region, safeguard Europe’s prosperity and security: Foreign Minister Wadephul is travelling to Prague for bilateral talks. Germany and Czechia are more than just neighbours. Our two countries share an 800-kilometre border, profound historical ties and a close economic partnership. Particularly given the current security situation in Europe, this partnership is taking on new importance: it is an expression of a common understanding that Europe’s strength derives from cohesion, openness and cooperation. Strategic dialogue in challenging times The focal point of Foreign Minister Wadephul’s visit to Prague is his meeting with his Czech opposite number, Jan Lipavský. Both countries are quite clear about the threat posed by Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine: it is not only a matter of Ukraine’s territorial integrity, but also of defending the entire European peace and security order.  The Russian attacks on Ukraine have spread even further in recent days: every day, more innocent people in Ukraine are dying. Germany and Czechia are doing their utmost to ensure that Ukraine receives the greatest possible support for its defence against the Russian attack. The two countries are also driving forward the 18th package of sanctions against Russia. At the same time, Germany and Czechia are working to expose Russian disinformation, to strengthen social resilience and together to protect the foundations of a peaceful, free Europe. During their meeting in Prague, as part of the German-Czech Strategic Dialogue, the two Foreign Ministers will also sign a new work programme comprising over 50 points and intended to further deepen bilateral cooperation. This Strategic Dialogue covers areas such as energy policy, digitisation, innovation, and the opportunities and risks of artificial intelligence. Border region as a living example of European partnership Another key topic of the visit is cooperation in the German-Czech border region, a microcosm of European integration in practice day by day: close economic links, personal friendships, joint education projects and cultural exchange. More than 400,000 school pupils in Czechia are learning German – an impressive reflection of the interest in the language of their neighbour, and the basis for even closer relations in the future. For almost three decades, the German-Czech Future Fund has played a key role in strengthening the border region, promoting projects that bring together people on both sides of the border, build trust and enhance mutual understanding. For Foreign Minister Wadephul, this work is not merely a symbol, but a tangible contribution to European stability and cohesion. Young voices for Europe’s future In the afternoon, Foreign Minister Wadephul and his Czech counterpart will meet participants in and alumni of the Czech-German Young Professionals Program (CGYPP) in Prague. This network links young professionals and executives from both countries and promotes open exchange. The focus this time is the question of how German and Czech diplomacy can help to strengthen democracy and the rule of law – not least in the light of the repercussions of the war in Ukraine and the challenges posed by disinformation and authoritarian tendencies.

15. **2025-07-01 14:03 UTC** - We stand shoulder to shoulder with Ukraine: Foreign Minister Wadephul travels to Kyiv. Russia’s war of aggression continues to ravage Ukraine each and every day and the people of Kyiv are facing the heaviest shelling in months. Day in, day out, the Kremlin’s drones and missiles are striking innocent civilians in Ukrainian cities.  Ukraine is defending itself with impressive strength, courage and determination. The Ukrainian forces near Sumy have managed to halt the Russian summer offensive for the time being. One thing remains clear, however, which is that Russia’s aggression threatens not only Ukraine but also our security throughout Europe. Together we are fortifying ourselves against this threat, which is why we are standing shoulder to shoulder with Ukraine. And we are continuing to strengthen our defences. We reaffirmed this once again with our partners around the world at the NATO Summit in The Hague last week. Europe stands resolutely by Kyiv’s side We will continue to support Ukraine in all areas –especially in the military domain. Germany’s support is having an impact, whether in the form of self-propelled howitzers, the IRIS-T air defence system or drinking water treatment plants.  Foreign Minister Wadephul met Ukrainian President Zelensky and Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha in the Ukrainian capital Kyiv for talks.  Upon his arrival in Kyiv, Foreign Minister Wadephul stated the following: In Ukraine it will be decided whether our Europe remains a place where freedom and human dignity hold sway, or becomes a continent on which violence can be used to redraw borders. The Ukrainian people are defending not only the freedom and sovereignty of their country, but also the security and freedom of Europe in the face of Putin’s aggression. That is why we will continue to fully concentrate on supporting Ukraine. Foreign Minister Wadephul also held talks with representatives from Ukrainian civil society during his visit. Among other things, they discussed the reform efforts Ukraine is undertaking to combat corruption and gradually align itself with EU standards. We are fully committed to freedom, stability and prosperity in Ukraine and will continue to support the country on its path towards EU and NATO membership. Commemorating the crimes committed by Nazi Germany in Babyn Yar A visit to the memorial site in Babyn Yar is particularly moving for all Germans. Within the space of two days, on 29 and 30 September 1941, SS troops murdered more than 33,000 Jewish men, women and children here on the outskirts of Kyiv. In total, more than 100,000 people were murdered on the Babyn Yar site during the Second World War up until liberation. The Babyn Yar massacre is symbolic of the cruelty of the Shoah in Ukraine. For decades, the massacre was a taboo subject in the Soviet Union and commemorating Jewish victims was forbidden.  Today, Babyn Yar is a memorial and a place of remembrance for the victims of Nazi violence. On 1 March 2022, Russian missiles struck Babyn Yar, setting fire to a building at the memorial site.  Odesa: Contested gateway to the world The port of Odesa connects Ukraine with the world. Every year, millions of tonnes of goods such as grain and sunflower oil are shipped from here to Africa, Asia, the US and Europe.  The Russian army continues to target the strategically important Black Sea ports from the air. Time and again, tonnes of grain have been destroyed by missile attacks; just recently, port workers were killed. Foreign Minister Wadephul and his Ukrainian counterpart Sybiha visited the port facilities to see the situation on the ground for themselves.  Germany is providing federal guarantees for the largest freight terminal – this is the second-largest German investment in Ukraine. Likewise, our support for air defence is protecting people and also helps ensure that the ports, which are of such crucial importance, remain operational despite the constant Russian attacks.  Supporting Moldova’s path towards the EU Ukraine’s small neighbour has been successfully standing up to the direct impacts of Russia’s war against Ukraine for years, and in particular to the massive Russian disinformation campaigns carried out within Moldova’s borders. Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine is posing major challenges for the country. When the war broke out, Moldova took in the largest number of refugees from Ukraine per capita.  The war also dramatically exacerbated the energy crisis in the country. However, with the support of Germany and its partners, Moldova has managed to stabilise its economy and fend off Russia’s hybrid attacks. Moldova has been an EU accession country since June 2022. In October 2024, a majority of Moldovans voted in a referendum in favour of enshrining the country’s accession to the EU in the constitution. The courageous people of Ukraine and Moldova are defending European security, our values and our freedom each and every day. For NATO, the EU and all Europeans, it is clear that, in the face of the Russian threat, we will now be investing heavily in our defence capabilities so that we too can contribute to the security of our continent.

16. **2025-06-26 18:11 UTC** - Ongoing fighting in Gaza – Germany continues its assistance. For many months, the quantity of relief supplies crossing the border into Gaza has been inadequate and the humanitarian situation there remains disastrous. Following the entry into effect of the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas on 20 January, for a few weeks there was finally tangible hope that the situation would improve – both for the hostages and their families and for the people of Gaza. The renewed Israeli ground offensive since mid-May has brought a rapid deterioration in the humanitarian situation facing the people in Gaza. Shots have been fired at people seeking help from food distribution centres, with several hundred being killed in the past few weeks. Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul has repeatedly urged that the situation of the people in Gaza must not be ignored. During a joint press conference with his Jordanian colleague on 18 June, Foreign Minister Wadephul stated: Almost every day, people are being shot while trying to get assistance for themselves and their families. The situation is unacceptable. The only way to ease the situation is to get more humanitarian assistance to the people. The United Nations’ efficient, established system stands ready here. Germany expressly supports these efforts, which have proved to work well. Without international aid organisations, there will be no end to the suffering in Gaza. The humanitarian aid workers must be able to do their job. According to the United Nations, some 1.9 million people in Gaza – or around 90% of the population – are internally displaced. Some of these people have already had to flee several times over and are now in areas where there is insufficient infrastructure to provide for them. The supply of basic provisions for the civilian population has collapsed. Hundreds of thousands of people, including many children, continue to lack bare essentials, above all food, water and medical care. Assistance from Germany: Food and medical care Since the very start of the war, Germany’s assistance has been focused on the most urgent needs of the people on the ground: medical and food aid – such as the distribution of food baskets and food supplements, the deployment of emergency medical teams and psychosocial support for families.
